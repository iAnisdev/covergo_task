# Covergo Vue Wizard form
In this file i willl be explaining technical choices, architecture and the approach used for completing multi-step form (wizard) test task.

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3
- Vuex
- VueRouter
- Typescript
- Tailwind css
- @vue/test-utils

## Architecture

I have choose SPA architecture for the application.


## Approach


For the project i have tried to give a touch to almost every main feature of vue such as 

- views
- components
    - props
    - events
- router
- store

as well used both option and composition API, just to showcase that i have worked with both.

i have followed a very simple approach as per design and have started with a start router followed by a form and then summary.
